Good morning,

a few months ago, we were contacted by a company from your industry, wher=
e too high costs were generated by the purchase of silicone rubbers and s=
ilicone mixtures with specific properties.

We offered them a wide range of HTV silicone rubbers with technical prope=
rties and liquid silicone rubber (LSR), as well as dyes and stabilizers. =
Competitive conditions made it possible to flexibly adjust to their needs=
 and type of production.

Now the purchase and delivery of rubber runs smoothly, the client has gai=
ned a significant increase in savings in relation to the planned budget a=
t the level of several percent per year.

Would you like to check what solutions we can provide you?


Best regards
Zbynek Spacek
