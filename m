Hi Folks,


Welcome back from Cephalocon!  Perf meeting is on in ~15 minutes.  I'm 
sending this both to the old and the new ceph development lists, but in 
the future these emails will only be sent to the new dev@ceph.io list so 
please remember to register!

Today we will talk a bit about some of the discussion that happened at 
cephalocon around the new community performance hardware, plans for 
incerta, Jenkins performance testing, autotuning, and trocksdb.
