Yeah, this is tricky business, and the MDS side of things is definitely
not my area of expertise. What kind of "other stuff" do you mean in this
case?

In any case, after thinking about this a bit, what may be best is to add
new "crypto_info" field to the inode. This field would basically be
opaque to the MDS, but it'd need to record and track changes to it.

It might be good to make that field some multiple of 16 bytes (which is
the fundamental fscrypt blocksize). I like the idea of being able to
encrypt this info, and there may be other private info we'd wish to
stash in there later.

We could consider tacking this field onto the encryption context xattr,
but I'm not sure that's the best idea.

Oh right, I sort of remember seeing this at some point.

I think this can still work -- the MDS would just be determining the
rounded-up size of the file. The client would need to determine the
length of the last object though. It can't use the size of the object at
that point, so we'd need to come up with some other way to track the
size.

One idea might be to just set an xattr on the object with the latest
size of the decrypted object when we do a write? We'd have to do it in
the same WRITE compound op, but that could be done. We could even
encrypt that data too since prying eyes don't need to know.

Then the client could just vet the size in the xattr of the last object
vs. the (private) one in the inode.

Either way, I'm going to need to enlist some help for the MDS side of
this bit, I think, and whoever picks up that part should probably be
involved in the design.
