List-ID: <ceph-devel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org

We are splitting the ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org list into two:

- dev@ceph.io 

  This will be the new general purpose Ceph development discussion list.  
  We encourage all subscribers to the current ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org 
  to subscribe to this new list.

  Subscribe to the new list is now at:

    https://lists.ceph.io/postorius/lists/dev.ceph.io/

- ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org

  The current list will continue to exist, but its role will shift to 
  Linux kernel-related traffic, including kernel patches and discussion of 
  implementation details for the kernel client code.

  At some point in the future, when all non-kernel discussion has shifted 
  to the new list, you might want to unsubscribe from the old list.

Please subscribe to the new list as people have already stopped CCing 
ceph-devel in some threads.

Thanks!
sage
