I think we probably want to change the behavior so that the default name 
is empty instead of admin, and the MDS refuses to start as 'mds.'.  It 
means wading through some of the common/ and global/ code, which is always 
an adventure, but the same cleanup should apply to all of the non-client 
entity types (osd, mgr, mon, etc) too, so it should be time well spent!
