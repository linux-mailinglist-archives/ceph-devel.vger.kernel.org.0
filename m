From: Xiubo Li <xiubli@redhat.com>

This patch series is based on Jeff Layton's previous great work and effort
on this.

Since v15 we have added the ceph qa teuthology test cases for this [1][2],
which will test both the file name and contents encryption features and at
the same time they will also test the IO benchmarks.

To support the fscrypt we also have some other work in ceph [3][4][5][6][7][8]:

[1] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/48628
[2] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/49934
[3] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/43588
[4] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/37297
[5] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45192
[6] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45312
[7] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/40828
[8] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45224
[9] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45073

The [8] and [9] are still undering testing and will soon be merged after
that. All the others had been merged long time ago.

The main changes since v15:

- rebased onto v6.2

- some minor cleanups and revises reported by:
  kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>
  Milind Changire <mchangir@redhat.com>
  Ilya Dryomov <idryomov@gmail.com>

- Luis' fixes:
  ceph: mark directory as non-complete complete after loading key
  ceph: fix memory leak in mount error path when using test_dummy_encryption
  ceph: allow encrypting a directory while not having Ax caps

  NOTE: the second one has been folded into a previous commit.

- fixed a sequence bug to make sure the osd req->r_callback()s are
  called before removing the reqs from the osdc, which will cause
  a warning in fscrypt_destroy_keyring() and potential use-after-free
  crash bugs in other places.
