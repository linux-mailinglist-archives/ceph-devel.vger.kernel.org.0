You can add my Tested-by for your fscache-next branch series ending at
commit  235299002012 netfs: Hold a ref on a page when PG_private_2 is set
This series includes your commit c723f0232c9f8928b3b15786499637bda3121f41
discussed a little earlier in this email thread.

I ran over 24 hours of NFS tests (unit, connectathon, xfstests,
various servers and all NFS versions) on your latest series
and it looks good.  Note I did not run against pNFS servers
due to known issue, and I did not do more advanced tests like
error injections.  I did get one OOM on xfstest generic/551 on
one testbed, but that same' test passed on another testbed,
so it's not clear what is happening there and it could very
well be testbed or NFS related.

In addition, I reviewed various patches in the series, especially the
API portions of the netfs patches, so for those, Reviewed-by is
appropriate as well. I have also reviewed some of the internals
of the other infrastructure patches, but my review is more limited
there.
