I can hardly imagine why it should ever be.  Being disk-bound, and
considering that even very old CPUs hardly have trouble keeping up with
the much slower storage devices, I can't imagine a reason for ceph or
anything portable across multiple architectures to tech to *demand*
newer CPUs of any of the supported architectures.  Hopefully there will
always be some portable fallback to resort to.

Oh, thanks, I didn't mean to burden anyone with that, it's just
something that I care about and would be happy to undertake myself.  I
was just surprised that there weren't i686 ceph packages in Fedora 30,
and found comments in the spec file suggesting it didn't work, but I
didn't look into why yet.
