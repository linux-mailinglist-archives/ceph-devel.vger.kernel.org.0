Hi everyone,

We talked a bit about this during the CLT meeting this morning.  How about 
the following proposal:

- Target release date of Mar 1 each year.
- Target freeze in Dec.  That will allow us to use the holidays to do a 
  lot of testing when the lab infrastructure tends to be somewhat idle.

If we get an early build out at the point of the freeze (or even earlier), 
perhaps this capture some of the time that the retailers have during their 
lockdown to identify structural issues with release.  It is probably 
better to do more of this testing at this point in the cycle so that we 
have time to properly fix any big issues (like performance or scaling 
regressions).  It is of course a challenge to motivate testing on 
something that is too far from the final a release, but we can try.

This avoids an abbreviated octopus cycle, and avoids placing August (which 
also often has people out for vacations) right in the middle of the 
lead-up to the freeze.

Thoughts?
sage
