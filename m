Luis,

Could you reproduce it with the latest testing branch ?

I never seen the generic/123 failure yet. And just now I ran the test 
for many times locally it worked fine.

 From the generic/123 test code it will never touch the key while 
testing, that means the dentries under the test dir will always have the 
keyed name. And then the 'fscrypt_d_revalidate()' should return 1 always.

Only when we remove the key will it trigger evicting the inodes and then 
when we add the key back will the 'fscrypt_d_revalidate()' return 0 by 
checking the 'fscrypt_has_encryption_key()'.

As I remembered we have one or more fixes about this those days, not 
sure whether you were hitting those bugs we have already fixed ?

Thanks

- Xiubo
