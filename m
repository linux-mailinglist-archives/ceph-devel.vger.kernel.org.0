The same cluster is actively receiving writes from older kernels (5.13), and it was initially reported at https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/73408, where a user reports that 5.15 kernels also work.

Yeah, I came to the exact same analysis and subsequent question in:
https://lore.kernel.org/ceph-devel/20220125111111.irvr4dg3i56crqrs@wittgenstein

It seems to me that selinux support is compiled in in archlinux but no
policy loaded/enabled. I don't know if that means that the hooks is
called and by default returns 0 or something. I'm rather confused as the
call_int_hook() implies -EOPNOTSUPP is returned but looking at
dentry_init_security as defined in LSM_HOOKS(int, 0,
dentry_init_security, [...]) in include/linux/lsm_hook_defs.h implies
that the default return value is 0.
