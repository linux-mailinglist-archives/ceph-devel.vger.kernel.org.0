Not necessary.  You can do the getaddrinfo lookup first and then perform
the query.

Yes (but res_mkquery builds a packet, it does not send it).

And it will switch servers at that point?  Or only if the existing
server association fails/times out?

What's are higher-level effects of that?

I'm still not convinced that the kernel *needs* accurate TTL
information.  The benefit from upcall avoidance likely vanishes quickly
after the in-kernel TTL increases beyond 5 or so.  That's just my guess,
though.

Thanks,
Florian
