Self-NAK on this patch...

Zheng pointed out that this array is actually freed by the request
handler after the submission. This loop is creating a new pages array
for a second request.

As far as whether we need to memset the end of the original array...I
don't think we do. It looks like the pointers at the end of the array
are ignored once you go past the length of the request. That said, it's
fairly cheap to do so, and I'm not inclined to change it, just in case
there is code that does look at those pointers.
