That sounds like it would work. I'll probably take something like that
approach.

In principle, the MDS really should not care about the logical size of
the file at all. All it needs to know is how big the actual backing
objects are, and that will always be rounded up to the next crypto
block.

So, I'm sort of a fan of the idea of having a "private" size field that
only the clients with valid the crypto keys use. Everything else would
just report (and deal with) the rounded-up size. So, the clients would
always set the current inode size field to the rounded-up size, and then
maintain the actual logical file size in their private field.

This has the advantage that we don't need to tinker with the MDS
mechanics so much -- only extend the inode with the new field (which
sucks, but is a reasonably mechanical change).

This also dovetails nicely with having the client "lazily" zero-pad the
EOF block after resetting the size.

How does this probing work today?

That does sound like a good idea, and it wouldn't be too difficult to
implement since we're already going to be moving to doing more multi-op
OSD write calls anyway.
