This patch series is based on Jeff Layton's previous great work and effort
on this and all the patches bas been in the testing branch since this
Monday(20 Mar)

Since v15 we have added the ceph qa teuthology test cases for this [1][2],
which will test both the file name and contents encryption features and at
the same time they will also test the IO benchmarks.

To support the fscrypt we also have some other work in ceph [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]:

[1] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/48628
[2] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/49934
[3] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/43588
[4] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/37297
[5] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45192
[6] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45312
[7] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/40828
[8] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45224
[9] https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45073

The [9] is still undering testing and will soon be merged after that. All
the others had been merged.

This will depend on Eric's [10] which is a [DO NOT MERGE] patch in the
ceph-client's testing branch temporarily.

[10] https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/fscrypt/linux.git/log/?h=for-next,

The main changes since v16:

- rebased onto v6.3 rc3

- An bug fix for size truncating, which will cause the pagecaches to be
  incorrectly truncated.
- Luis fixed atomic open bug for encrypted directories
