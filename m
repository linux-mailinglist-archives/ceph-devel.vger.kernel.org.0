Spring had a slight edge over fall in the twitter poll (for whatever 
that's worth).  I see the appeal for fall when it comes to down time for  
retailers, but as a practical matter for Octopus specifically, a target of
say October means freezing in August, which means we only have 2
more months of development time.  I'm worried that will turn Octopus 
in another weak (aka lightly adopted) release.

March would mean freezing in January again, which would give us July to 
Dec... 6 more months.
