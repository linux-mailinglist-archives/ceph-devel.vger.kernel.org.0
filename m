If you use google calendar and want to add this to your calendar, you can 
use calendar id

These meetings are generally open to any developer.  If you have a bug 
you're working on, a pull request you have questions about, or just want 
to follow what the team is working on, you are welcome to join.

A few of the meetings are also targetting end users, notably the 
performance weekly meeting on Thursdays.

Thanks!
