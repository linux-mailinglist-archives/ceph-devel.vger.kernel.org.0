Thanks, Christoph.

That part of the patch description is unclear. I'll fix that up, but
this patch does ensure that no buffered I/O can take place while any
direct I/O is in flight. Only operations of the same "flavor" can run
in parallel. Note that we _do_ use the i_rwsem here, but there is also
an additional per-inode flag that handles the buffered read/direct I/O
exclusion.

I did take a look at the xfs_ilock* code this morning. That's quite a
bit more complex than this. It's possible that ceph doesn't serialize
mmap I/O and O_DIRECT properly. I'll have to look over xfstests and see
whether there is a good test for that as well and whether it passes.

Cheers,
