No, I meant in writepages_finish(). It has this:

        if (osd_data->pages_from_pool)
                mempool_free(osd_data->pages,
                             ceph_sb_to_client(inode->i_sb)->wb_pagevec_pool);
        else
                kfree(osd_data->pages);

The pages themselves are freed in the loop above that point however.
