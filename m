Good Day

I am Mr Reginald Mooyo, a member of the South African Settlement Committee 
(SASC).
 
South African Settlement Committee (SASC). South Africa is charged with the 
responsibility of finding bank accounts in South Africa belonging to Non-South 
African indigenes, which have remained dormant since South African apartheid 
was resolved in 1994. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the 
South African Reserve Bank published a list of dormant accounts originally 
opened by non- South African citizens.
 
These accounts had been dormant since the end of apartheid (27 April 1994). 
Most belonged to apartheid victims. The continuing efforts of the South 
African Settlement Committee (SASC) have since resulted in the discovery of 
additional dormant accounts -14,000 in December 1999. The published lists 
contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings 
accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-
interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. 
Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.
 
The Claims Resolution Panel (CRP) handles processing of all claims on accounts 
due to non-South African citizens. I discovered a dormant account of Mr. Earl 
W Bennett with a credit balance of US$ 67,000,000 (Sixty-Seven Million United 
State dollars) plus accumulated interest.
 
The beneficiary was murdered during the apartheid era, leaving no WILL and no 
possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Panel has been 
mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and 
transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of South African 
government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased 
beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills). Being a top executive at 
SASC, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds 
without any hitch.
 
The funds will be banked in a Very Reliable Bank here in South African and we 
can share the funds and use in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive 
nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is 
required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the 
necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds 
in your name. Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone 
number.
 
I will ensure all procedures to see that the fund is transferred to a secure, 
numbered account in your name here in South African, of which you will be 
capable of accessing the funds and transferring gradually to your country and 
other banks of our choice in the world.
 
My share will be 75% and your share 25% of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK 
INVOLVED.
 
The Claims Resolution Panel has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of 
valid claims for necessary disbursement. I find myself privileged to have this 
information and this may be a great opportunity for a lifetime success without 
risks.
 
Due to security reasons, reply to my private emails: mooyoreg@gmail.com, or 
contact Tel +27 66 5555 800.
 
This transaction is not a Childs Play and should not be treated as such, if 
you are capable then reply, if not please kindly delete.
 
Best Regards
Reginald Mooyo
Member (SASC)
