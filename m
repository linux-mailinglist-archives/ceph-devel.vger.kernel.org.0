Hi,

After upgrading some old Phenom servers from Fedora/Freed-ora 29 to
30's, to ceph-14.2.2, I was surprised by very early crashes of both
ceph-mon and ceph-osd.  After ruling out disk and memory corruption, I
investigated a bit noticed all of them crashed during pre-main() init
section processing, at an instruction not available on the Phenom X6
processors that support sse4a, but not e.g. sse4.1.

It turns out that much of librte is built with -march=corei7.  That's a
little excessive, considering that x86/rte_memcpy.h would be happy
enough with -msse4.1, but not with earlier sse versions that Fedora is
supposed to target.

I understand rte_memcpy.h is meant for better performance, inlining
fixed-size and known-alignment implementations of memcpy into users.
Alas, that requires setting a baseline target processor, and you'll only
get as efficient an implementation as what's built in.

I noticed an attempt for dynamic selection, but GCC rightfully won't
inline across different target flags, so we'd have to give up inlining
to get better dynamic behavior.  The good news is that glibc already
offers dynamic selection of memcpy implementations, so hopefully the
impact of this change won't be much worse than that of enabling dynamic
selection, without the complications.

If that's not good enough, compiling ceph with flags that enable SSE4.1,
AVX2 or AVX512, or with a -march flag that implicitly enables them,
would restore current performance, but without that, you will (with the
patch below) get a package that runs on a broader range of processors,
that the base distro (through the compiler's baseline flags) chooses to
support.  It's not nice when you install a package on a processor that's
supposed to be supported and suddenly you're no longer sure it is ;-)

Perhaps building a shared librte, so that one could build and install
builds targeting different ISA versions, without having to rebuild all
of ceph, would be a reasonable way to address the better tuning of these
performance-critical bits.
