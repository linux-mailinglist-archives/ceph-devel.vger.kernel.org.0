Hi - One of my colleagues (Jianpeng) created this repo - https://github.com/ceph/nvml and he's on a long leave now. We at Intel need this upgraded for the upcoming write-back caching work based on pmem.

Could you let me know how to get access to that repo? At the moment I can't update the repo or edit the repo name (it's outdated).

Best,
Mahati
